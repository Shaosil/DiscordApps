Come on {USER}, what were you thinking?
{USER}, I literally can't even...
Hey guys, {USER} did a bad thing.
Seriously {USER}? You just had to go there.
Hey {USER}! The odds have ruled against you. Better luck next time.
Why, {USER}, just why?
This is obviously {USER}'s fault.
Oh look who dunnit this time. That's right, it's {USER}.
Why am I not surprised, {USER}?
SURE, {USER}, like it could have been anyone else.
HEY EVERYONE! {USER} DID A BAD THING!
Don't make me come down there {USER}.
Now {USER}, what did I tell you about this behavior?
Once upon a time, {USER} did a dumb.
Don't talk to me or my server ever again, {USER}.
I'm embarassed to even know you right now {USER}.
How could {USER} have done this?
If you look up 'at fault' in the dictionary, {USER}'s picture will be there.
Don't deny it, {USER}. YOU are to blame for this.
Just when I thought {USER} couldn't get any worse, THIS happened.
